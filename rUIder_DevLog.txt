NOW

- Getting the speech recog working
	+  make sure right arrow key works!
	+  timing with the analysis and getting next sentence

	+   BUG: what happens when I want to stop and restart the speech recognition?
		 clicking the "stop recognizing" button calls recognition.stop(), which leads the .onend callback function to execute. 
		 --> I need a way to distinguish between ending the entire speech session, and ending the paragraph --> boolean variable called endParagraphSession
	+ get rid of needless outputs that hinder debuggging

	- BUG: How do you deal with numbers or dollar signs? and inaccuracies in speech recognition
		--> could try to create and edit a SpeechGrammarList that we perhaps append to the default grammar and provide weights such that the supplied targetText has a higher probability of being correct.
	- BUG: Sometimes your spokenSentenceArray has more elements than the targetSentenceArray. --> causes the insertion of an "undefined" element into the text :(

	+ showFeedback function: currently analyzeSpokenSentence takes in spoken sentence and target sentence and returns optimal backtrace and messages
		wrote the following general function--not sure if not rlly necessary
		also called findAndAddSpan function in the startButton func
	+ clearFeedback func: simple yay! --- just resets the text

	THOUGHTS on DESIGN:
			- if the user sees feedback, they may want to mouseover right away, do we just stop speech recognition when that happens and have them restart the highlighting again?


-integrating into chrome extension
	- add visual indicator of speech recog on or off (picture of mic somewhere?)
	- maintain customizability <-- add toggling functionality for our features
		- speech recog 
		- sentence isolation 
			- changing opacity of isolation
			- how do we handle multiple sentences (changing number of sentences isolated)

		
have a data structure keep track of word wrong & number of words wrong & word type--dictionary?
			this is something the browser will hold onto

*allow the reader to decide when he/she gets feedback!--perhaps at the end of the reading?
