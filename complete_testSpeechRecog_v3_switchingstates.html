	  <p> A girl named Riley is born in Minnesota, and within her mind, five personifications of her basic emotions — Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust and Anger - come to life. The emotions live in Headquarters, Riley's conscious mind, where they influence Riley's actions and memories via a control console. Her new memories are housed in colored orbs, which are sent into long-term memory at the end of every waking period. The most important memories, known as "core" memories, are housed in a hub in Headquarters and power five "islands", each of which reflects a different aspect of Riley's personality. Joy does everything in her power to keep Riley in a happy state, but since she and the other emotions do not understand Sadness's purpose, they try to keep her from controlling the console.</p>
